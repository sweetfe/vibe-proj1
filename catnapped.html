  <p>Once upon a time in the sun-dappled hills of Napa, there lived a regal young feline — clever, curious, and charming in that aloof sort of way cats perfect by birthright. Life was good, filled with tree climbing, bird watching, and napping in the golden afternoon light.</p>
  
  <p>But one day… she was catnapped.</p>
  
  <p>No one knows exactly how it happened — a crate, a car, a well-meaning human? Either way, she found herself scooped up and whisked far from her domain, the scent of vineyards replaced by the confusing buzz of human cities. She tried to adjust. She even tried to forgive. But before she could form a plan, it happened again.</p>
  
  <p>She was catnapped a second time.</p>
  
  <p>This time, though, the fates had something kinder in mind. Her captors (or perhaps rescuers?) brought her to the wonderful folks at the San Francisco SPCA — a place full of gentle hands, soft blankets, and the smell of tuna treats. She bided her time, watched the comings and goings, and practiced her most majestic poses in preparation.</p>
  
  <p>And then… her human came.</p>
  
  <p>Not just any human — her human. The one who instantly saw the spark behind those dignified green eyes. The one who understood that this was no ordinary cat, but royalty displaced.</p>
  
  <p>Her new human didn't just take her home. She returned her to her kingdom.</p>
  
  <p>Now, Kitty reigns once more — over counters, sunny windowsills, soft laundry piles, and the comings and goings of her loyal subject. Her abductions are behind her. The throne is hers. And she rules with an iron paw (sheathed in velvet, of course).</p>
  
  <p>Long may she nap.</p>
