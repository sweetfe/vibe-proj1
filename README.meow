# Meow Sound Implementation

This file explains how to add a real meow sound to the Meow button.

## Current Implementation

The Meow button is currently implemented with placeholder functionality that shows an alert when clicked, since no audio file is available yet.

## Adding a Real Meow Sound

To add a real meow sound:

1. Obtain a meow sound file in MP3, WAV, or OGG format
2. Place the file in the `sounds/` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
3. Update the `index.html` file to add the source to the audio element:

```html
<!-- Audio element for meow sound -->
<audio id="meowSound" preload="auto">
  <source src="sounds/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <!-- Add additional sources for browser compatibility -->
  <source src="sounds/meow.wav" type="audio/wav">
  <source src="sounds/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

4. The JavaScript functionality is already implemented to play the sound when the button is clicked

## Sound File Recommendations

- Keep the file size small for fast loading
- Use a clear, recognizable cat meow sound
- Consider using a free sound from sites like:
  - Freesound.org
  - Zapsplat.com
  - Soundbible.com

## Technical Details

The implementation uses the HTML5 Audio API:
- `audioElement.play()` to play the sound
- Error handling for browsers that don't support audio
- Preloading for better user experience
