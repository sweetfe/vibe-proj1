  <p>Malla has a very particular way of showing her affection during petting sessions. She'll start by purring contentedly, kneading with her front paws, and leaning into the scratches behind her ears. But just when you think she's in complete bliss, she'll suddenly turn and give you a gentle love bite.</p>
  
  <p>These bites are not aggressiveâ€”rather, they're her way of saying "I've had enough" or "That's perfect, just like that." It's as if she's marking her territory, claiming you as her own with a tiny puncture that barely breaks the skin.</p>
  
  <p>Over the years, her humans have learned to recognize the signs: the half-closed eyes, the twitching tail, and then that sudden nip. It's become a game of sorts, trying to predict exactly when she'll decide she's had the perfect amount of attention.</p>
  
  <p>These love bites are badges of honor in the household, proof that you've been chosen by the queen herself for special affection. After all, only those she truly trusts would be worthy of such intimate gestures.</p>
